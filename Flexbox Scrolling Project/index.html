    <!-- Have a list of cards in html. Arrange the cards in a flexbox where after 3 cards they wrap to the next row.

    On a mobile view, have 1 card per row. Using css media queries.

    Use flexboxes at the top level to arrange a header, body, and footer. Have the header and footer be a specific height and have the body grow to fill the remainder of the page. The body will never push the footer out of view. When the content inside the body is too large, have the body be scrollable (again, without pushing the footer out of view).
