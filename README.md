# Vanilla-Web-Development
---
This project is to boost the understanding of core HTML, CSS, and JavaScriptâ€”without relying on frameworks or libraries. The goal is to showcase my ability to build responsive, interactive, and functional web pages using only native web technologies.

The project consists of various web pages and mini-projects that implement fundamental concepts like layout design, form handling, DOM manipulation, and responsive design. The focus is on clean, well-structured code, ensuring compatibility across different browsers and screen sizes.
